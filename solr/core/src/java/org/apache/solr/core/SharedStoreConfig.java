/**
 * Configuration class representing the configuration of Solr Cloud using shared storage
 * to persist index files. The configuration properties come from solr.xml and are loaded
 * via {@link SolrXmlConfig} at Solr startup. The presence of sharedStore section in the solr.xml
 * file of a Solr Cloud mode cluster indicates the user's intention to enable shared storage 
 * capabilities in the cluster and starts the necessary components required to create/support
 * shared-type Solr collections.
 * 
 * TODO: This class is bare bones until we convert the many hard coded configuration values
 * into configurable fields that can be specified under this section. The current responsibility
 * of this class is to ensure shared storage is enabled on the cluster and initiate the necessary
 * processes associated with it.
